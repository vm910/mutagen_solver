# MUTAGEN SOLVER FOR UNDERRAIL

Scuffed mutagen solver for Underrails mutagen puzzle. It's slow and dumb (just a standard BFS).

I added the `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolsExecutor()` module in an effor to speed things up.

Also added pretty logging. All in all, learned alot from this.

Still want to add some sort of evaluation to eliminate certain reagents from being used all together.
